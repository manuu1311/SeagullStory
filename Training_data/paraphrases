INFERENCE
A compassionate sailor rescued Albert and Dave from an island, guiding them to a dock using his boat. Currently, they are feeling 
sorrowful and stunned. Albert is unaware that Lucy has passed away, but Dave is fully aware of her demise. Both Albert and Dave are 
feeling fatigued. They engage in conversations and discussions. Albert's intention to dine on seagull meat remains 
unaltered, as he had conceived this plan while they were on the island. Nothing that occurred subsequently has caused 
Albert to change his mind. They proceed to visit a restaurant, where Albert orders seagull meat. The waiter promptly serves Albert with the seagull meat, which turns out to be quite ordinary and palatable. Upon taking a bite, Albert suddenly realizes he has 
never experienced seagull meat before, prompting him to start yelling. Dave, who had anticipated Albert's reaction, 
remains unsurprised. Other diners at the restaurant are taken aback by Albert's outburst.
