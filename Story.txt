In the early 900's, Bob, Tom, and Lucy are middle-aged friends. They are all completely normal people, except for Bob's blindness.  
Bob and Lucy are happily married. Religion doesn't play a significant role in this story. Bob's love for Lucy and Lucy's love for 
Bob create a strong and enduring bond between them. This story is completely plausible.

One day, Bob, Tom, and Lucy are enjoying a delightful time together on a boat, free from any conflicts or disagreements. However, 
their joyful outing takes a dramatic turn when they encounter a violent storm that wrecks their boat. As a result, the three friends 
find themselves stranded on a remote island, facing the challenges of survival in a place far from their initial plans. 

Lucy dies in the violent shipwreck, but Bob and Tom don't know it just yet. 
There is no one else in the island and there are no dangerous animals, so they do no have to fight to survive. 
However, they face the challenge of surviving with limited food: the island was scarce in food.
One day, while exploring the island, Tom makes a heartbreaking discovery. He stumbles upon Lucy's lifeless body. 
Tom is devastated, and the loss of their dear friend weighs heavily on him. 
Tom keeps his discovery for himself: if Bob knew it, he would be devastated. He even pretends that Lucy is still with them, and Bob 
believes him at first. 
As they continue their struggle for survival, Tom has no other options than eating some of Lucy's remains. He does not tell 
Bob the truth about their food source: Tom assures Bob they are eating seagull meat. In this moment, Bob starts doubting Tom's words. 
He is really suspicious, but decides to trust him for the time being. 
A fortunate turn of events finally occurs. A passing sailor spots Bob and Tom and rushes to their rescue. The sailor is a 
good-hearted man, genuinely concerned for their well-being. He helps them off the island and brings them to a nearby pier.
Bob and Tom are grateful for their rescue.

Finally, Bob and Tom find themselves at the pier due to these distressing events.They feel sad and shocked. 
Bob is still unaware of Lucy's fate, but is really suspicious and has discussions with Tom. Bob wants to go to a restaurant 
in order to taste seagull meat. So, they head to a nearby restaurant. Bob, orders seagull meat, like he planned. The waiter promptly 
serves Bob the dish, Bob takes a bite. The taste was unknown to Bob since it was his first time eating seagull meat: what he ate 
in the island was not seagull meat, but Lucy's corpse! He now understands and does what Tom suspected. 
To the surprise of the other people in the restaurant, but not to the surprise of Tom, Bob shoots himself. The seagull meat was 
perfectly fine.
