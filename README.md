# SeagullStory
Text based game where you have to unveil mystery surrounding Albert's death.
## The game 
You are told the final part of a story. It does not make sense at first, but in the end you can be sure it will actually make sense.  
  
You can ask boolean questions to which you will receive one of the following answers: 
  
"Yes" if it is true  
"No" if it is not true  
"Doesn't matter" if what you're asking is not important to understand the whole story.  

Your goal is to find out about the rest of the story. To win the game, you have to explain the reasons behind Albert's death.  

The story is breaken down into 3 different scenarios, each requiring unlocking before you can ask about Its events. Additionally, there are key facts scattered among these scenarios, that will be used for guidance and to track your progress.
